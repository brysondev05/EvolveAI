##### Bridge Block
A block of training that is selected before or after a macrocycle - it is akin to off-season training and helps to restore an athlete after the hard training of the macrocycle or to help re-introduce an athlete after a period of time off. 

##### Deload Week
The taper week is the last week of any hypertrophy or strength block. This week is based upon the previous week’s training but for broad strokes purposes, it is about 50% of the volume and 70% of the intensity of the last week of training before it. 

##### ESRI
ESRI refers to exercises, sets, reps, and intensity. Specifically, these four components make up the protocols that are organized to make a day of training for someone to perform and represent the smallest unit of training thought (whereas macrocycle is the largest).

##### Exercises
Exercises refer to the movement that is performed (eg. squat, bench press, deadlift, etc.)

##### Frequency
Frequency refers to (1) the number of times a lifter performs a type of movement or (2) how many days they workout in a week. For example, a person can be an a 4x frequency workout plan, meaning they workout in the gym 4 times a week. However, a person may or may not have a bench press movement on each day. Therefore, a person could be on a 4x frequency workout plan with a 3x frequency of bench press; this means they do 3 bench press exercises per week so at least one day would not have any bench press.

##### Hypertrophy
Hypertrophy refers to the increase of muscle mass and a hypertrophy block is a period of training focused on this goal instead of a focus on gaining strength. 

##### Macrocycle
A group of training blocks (also known as microcycles) composing a training plan with a beginning and an end.

##### MEV
Minimum Effective volume (MEV) is the amount of volume at which adaptation starts, it is the low end of training volume where, if performed week after week, would make the smallest amount of progress possible without simply maintaining strength. Its counterpart is MRV.

##### Microcycle
A block of training (usually 4-5 weeks long) that is focused upon a specific adaptation. The types of training blocks in the Expert System are Bridge, Hypertrophy, Strength, and Peaking.

##### MRV
Maximum Recoverable Volume is the most volume that a person can carry out without overtraining and getting weaker. Its counterpart is MEV.

##### Overloading Frequency
Overloading frequency (AKA “OF”)refers to how difficult an exercise is. In this system an OF of 1 means that the exercise is as hard as an exercise can be, an OF of .75 means it is a heavy assistance movement, and OF of .5 means it is a light assistance movement, and an OF of .25 means it is a technique day using an very easy protocol. OF is not to be confused with total frequency.

##### Powerlifting
Powerlifting is the sport of lifting as much weight for one repetition as you can in the squat, bench, and deadlift. 

##### Preparatory Days
Days of training making up less than a week that are added to the start of a microcycle to make it end at the end of a calendar week.

##### Repetition
A repetition (aka “rep”) is one complete movement of an exercise (eg. squatting down and then up is one repetition in the squat).

##### Sets
A set is composed of repetitions and is often written as 5x10 meaning 5 sets of 10 reps. In most cases, rest is taken between sets of repetitions to allow an athlete to recover and complete another group of reps. Sometimes sets are open-ended and do not have a number of reps but only have a weight or intensity listed with how much effort should be used (i.e. a certain level of exertion).  

##### Taper (or Taper Week)
A taper is a period of training where pre-planned workouts are performed at the end of a peak - the point is to release fatigue to be able to lift more than usual. 

##### Total Frequency
Total Frequency (AKA “TF”) refers to the number of times a person performs an exercise type, regardless of its overloading frequency amount (eg. an athlete who has two hard overloading exercises (both with an OF of 1) and one heavy assistance exercise (OF of .75) has a total frequency of 3 and an overloading frequency of 2.75. 

##### Training Week
A training week runs from Monday to Sunday - we start the week with Monday because the vast majority of powerlifting meets happen on Saturday or Sunday so it makes it easier to have Sunday be the last day of the week.

##### Transition Block
A period of 1-2 weeks that is added to the first microcycle to make the macrocycle the correct length - this is only used in certain situations with short timeframes where the number of weeks needed for the macrocycle can’t be created with blocks of 4 or 5 weeks.

##### Volume
Volume is usually a stand-in term for “total amount of work done” or “tonnage.” In the current exert system it usually refers to the number of sets a person can perform per week but is technically the tonnage found by adding up sets * reps * weight for all exercises (eg. 2 sets of 10 reps with 100 on squats would be a volume of 2 * 10 * 100=2000 lbs of volume).
